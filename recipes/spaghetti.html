        <h2>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. </h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Oil: You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Garlic: Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
            <li>Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Toast the garlic in olive oil.</li>
            <li>Stir the seasonings into the pasta, then stir in the garlic and oil.</li>
            <li>Toss with cheese.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>It's not traditional, but for extra richness add 1 tablespoon of butter when you toss with the cheese.</p>
